<!--        design considerations that talks about the choices we made creating our project and why-->
    <h1>Design Considerations</h1>
        <p>As opposed to our midterm project, we wanted to include all of the content on one page for easy access. We did link, however, to our different HTML pages from the midterm through our recommended books section to link the assignments together. We also wanted to create a scroll menu with all of the book selections so that users could view their book choices easily. We created a book generator to randomly select books based on the user's genre and length preferences. They could then add the books they like to a book reading list and indicate when they have completed the books. We extracted code from previous homework assignments, such as the ToDo List and the random fact generator.  </p>
    
<!--        challenges section that talks about the major challenges that our team faced and conquered-->
    <h1>Challenges</h1>
        <p>We originally wanted to use the GoodReads API, but we didn't understand how to use it and instead manually created objects with our own book choices. We had trouble generating the books based on the user's inputed genre and length, but we were able to get it to randomly generate books from a list in the beginning. With three functions, main(), checkGenre(), and checkLength(), we were able to compare the user's inputted selection with the keys and values of the genre and length objects to output the best matched book according to their taste. We had issues integrating the ToDo List code into our own, especially in making the add button work. Eventually, we found that getting the button element by id required that we change the index from 0 to 1 in order to indicate the correct button(our add button). We had issues in formatting the dropdown menu and linking the indicated books from the menu to the input field so that users could add them to their list. We used jQuery from another source to help us do so. We had also originally wanted to separate the list(completed, todo, etc) into separate tabs, but found that with the code we already had, it would be complicated to achieve.</p>
        
<!--        technology & acknowledgements section that lists the Javascript features and acknowledges people from whom we borrowed code. -->
    <h1>Technology & Acknowledgements</h1>
           <p>We used objects, functions, and manipulation of HTML elements using DOM and jQuery in our javascript file. We obtained the code for the scroll menu from <a href = "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18087088/using-arrow-buttons-to-scroll-window-horizontally">Stack Overflow</a> and also from <a href = "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17756649/disable-the-horizontal-scroll">Stack Overflow</a>, we found code to disable the horizontal scroll menu. We used code from <a href = "https://people.ucsc.edu/~aassi/art101/midterm/index.html">codepen</a> for our ToDo List. We also looked at <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_dropdown.asp">w3schools</a> and <a href = "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5653950/fill-in-input-field-by-clicking-link-with-jquery">Stack Overflow</a> for our dropdown menu of the list of books. <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_vertical_menu.asp">w3schools</a> also helped us in creating the vertical scroll for the book list.</p>
